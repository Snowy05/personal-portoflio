                    <p><strong>Project:</strong> Inventory Management System</p>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Developed an inventory management web
                        application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. 
                        The application manages stocks, orders, and user administration, 
                        and generates reports on sales (e.g., annual reports).</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> PHP, SQL, CSS, JavaScript</p>
                    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Scrum Master and Front-End Developer</p>
                    <p><strong>Responsibilities as Scrum Master:</strong> Facilitated Scrum
                        ceremonies (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and 
                        retrospectives), managed the team's progress using Agile artifacts 
                        (product backlog, sprint backlog, and burndown charts), and ensured
                        that Agile principles and practices were followed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Front-End Development:</strong> Designed and implemented responsive user
                        interfaces. Assisted with back-end development by contributing to server
                        -side scripting and database management.</p>
                    <p><strong>Team:</strong> Collaborated with a team of 5 developers</p>
                    <p><strong>Achievements:</strong> Delivered a fully functional inventory management
                        system that met client requirements and improved the efficiency of stock management
                        and reporting processes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Project Overview: </strong> 
                            We have been collaborating with an external client to develop a mobile 
                            application that meets their needs and those of their users. The primary goal 
                            is to track children's sleeping patterns and provide additional features to support 
                            parents and caregivers, such as bedtime reminders, tips for improving sleep quality, 
                            and activity logs. <br> The application aims to provide comprehensive insights into 
                            children's sleep habits, helping parents to identify patterns and make informed decisions 
                            for improving their child's overall well-being.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technologies: </strong>Flutter</p>
                        <p><strong>My Role: </strong> As a Scrum Master, I facilitate the Agile development process, 
                            leading daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, and retrospectives. I serve as a bridge
                             between the client and the development team to ensure clear communication and alignment 
                             on project goals, and work to remove any obstacles to the team's progress. <br> Additionally, 
                             I help in prioritizing tasks, managing the product backlog, and ensuring that the team delivers 
                             high-quality features in each sprint, ultimately contributing to the successful completion of the 
                             project.

                                  Created a project which was a decision-making reading game, specifically
                                   a text-based adventure game where players make choices to progress through
                                   the story. This project involved developing a dynamic narrative system and
                                   incorporating player decisions to influence the outcome of the game.
                               </p>
                               <p>Also created a C# application using Windows Forms, which served as a workout
                                   manager and logger. The app allowed users to log their workouts, track 
                                   progress over time, and manage their fitness routines. Additionally, it
                                   included a feature to pinpoint dates on a calendar and maintain a diary,
                                   enabling users to record personal notes and milestones.

                               <p><strong>This Year:</strong> Developed a console-based application called a 
                                   recipe manager. This app enables users to create, view, and manage their 
                                   recipes. It includes functionalities for adding ingredients, generating 
                                   shopping lists, and saving/loading data to and from files, providing a 
                                   comprehensive tool for recipe organization and meal planning.
